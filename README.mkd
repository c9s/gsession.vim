Global Session Plugin
============================================
gsession.vim saves your session files into the same directory (`~/.vim/session/`)
by default.  and auto-detect your session file to load session file when you
are opening vim editor without arguments. you can also define your session dir
by `g:session_dir` option.

gsession.vim also save your session file when you are leaving vim editor.

gsession.vim also support making a local session file `<leader>sS`, which is
just like `:mksession!` command. but you can define your favorite session
filename.

gsession.vim create different sessions for git branches. so session won't conflict 
between different branches.

Options
=======

    let g:session_dir            = '~/.vim/my-session'

if you prefer to put sessions in other place.

    let g:local_session_filename = '.session.vim'

if you want a better session filename.

    let g:autoload_session = 0
    let g:autosave_session = 0
